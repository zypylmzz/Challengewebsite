# Challengewebsite #

**Hi, this is my first website. That's why I'm so excited. I will write here week by week what I do and what technologies I use.**

### 1st and 5th weeks ###
I focused on html and css. I came up to the animation and scass sections in css. I normally share my progress on twitter, but I'll post it here as well.
I will also keep my twitter account and the resources I use updated from here.
